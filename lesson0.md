## What is Open Source?

In 1984, Richard Stallman launched the **GNU Project** and created the **General Public License** (GPL) as a response to his increasing unhappiness with proprietary software, vendor lock-in practices and the resulting loss of personal freedom, as he saw it.

> "When users don't control the program, we call it 'nonfree' or 'proprietary' software. The nonfree program controls the users, and the developer controls the program; this makes the program an instrument of unjust power"
> Richard Stallman, [The Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

This marked the birth of **Free Software**, by which software is considered free if it respects the 4 fundamental freedoms:

1. Anyone has the freedom to run the software as they wish, for any purpose
2. Anyone has the freedom to study how the program works, and change it as they wish
3. Anyone has the freedom to redistribute the software
4. Anyone has the freedom to distribute copies of their own modified version of the Software

As a consequence, access to the code must be open and all 3rd party software needed to run it must also comply with the 4 fundamental freedoms.

A few years later, in 1997, Eric Raymond wrote an essay called **"The Cathedral and the Bazaar"**, in which he described how the Linux operating system and the Free Software philosophy had created a surprisingly effective and collaborative way of writing software.

This set the stage for the appearance, one year later, of the term **Open Source** software. Open Source software is a close relative of Free Software but with a stronger focus on the methodology rather than the philosophy.

The movement has continued growing since then and nowadays there are many examples of popular Open Source software such as, for example, WordPress, Firefox, React, Python, the Apache web server and the MySQL database.

> **Exercise 2:** Can you think of any software that is "free" (as in you pay Â£0.00 for it) but would not qualify as Open Source?

## What is WordPress? WordPress.com versus WordPress.org


### What is WordPress

Include the following points:

*   It's an Open Source Content Management System (CMS)
*   How it started and by whom.
*   Market share
*   Its uses (blog, simple website, large website, multisite, e-commerce, , etc) with examples.

> **Exercise 1:** Find out what a Content Management System is.
>
> **Exercise 2:** Find more examples of WordPress sites, by type: a blog, a local business website, an e-commerce website, a news site, etc. Which is your favourite? What do you like about it?


### WordPress.com versus WordPress.org

Include the following points:

*   When we say WordPress, we mean WordPress.org
*   WordPress.com = hosted multisite install, run by Automattic, owned by Matt Mullenberg
*   Interaction/relationship between the two

Although the Dashboards look quite different, the key concepts (pages, posts, themes, customizer, settings, media gallery, etc.) are the same.

## What do WordPress developers do?

As an IT professional, there's different ways of working with WordPress:

*   You can build websites for clients using, and adapting, existing WordPress Themes ( = collection of templates for the frontend ) and Plugins ( = extensions to the default WordPress functionality ).
*   You can create WordPress Themes for clients or to sell them on platforms such as the [Theme Directory](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/themes/) or the [Theme Forest](https://themeforest.net).
*   You can create WordPress Plugins for clients or to sell on the [Plugin Repository](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/).

Of course, you can also earn a living as a content editor, a blogger or a business owner with a WordPress website. But that'd be outside the scope of this course ;-)

We will cover Themes and Plugins extensively during the course but, in the meantime, if you want to find out more, please refer to the following links in the WordPress Codex:

* [WordPress Developers Handbook - What is a Plugin](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/intro/what-is-a-plugin/)

## Homework

1.  **Create a blog with WordPress.com** \- The objective of this exercise is to help you become familiar with the key WordPress concepts.

    1.  Create a free account on wordpress.com and choose a name for the blog.
    2.  Choose a Theme.
    3.  Add an About page and type some content. A couple of lines will be enough.

    8.  Add a menu with the following items: Home, About and Contact. "Home" should link to the main blog page and "Contact" should link to an email address.

    Do as many of the tasks below as you can but don't worry if you get stuck with any of the steps. There is a lot of information in the [WordPress.com support site](https://en.support.wordpress.com/) or, if you can't find a solution there, please ask on Slack.

2.  **Setup your localhost with Docker** -
3.  **\[Bonus/Optional\]** Third part/optional - Hardest
4.  **Research:**
