## What is Open Source?

A brief summary of the philosophy behind Open Source. Probably with a link to the video recommended by ? in Slack.

## What is WordPress? WordPress.com versus WordPress.org

### What is WordPress

Include the following points:

*   It's an Open Source Content Management System (CMS)
*   How it started and by whom.
*   Market share
*   Its uses (blog, simple website, large website, multisite, e-commerce, , etc) with examples.

> **Exercise 1:** Find out what a Content Management System is.
> 
> **Exercise 2:** Find more examples of WordPress sites, by type: a blog, a local business website, an e-commerce website, a news site, etc. Which is your favourite? What do you like about it?

### WordPress.com versus WordPress.org

Include the following points:

*   When we say WordPress, we mean WordPress.org
*   WordPress.com = hosted multisite install, run by Automattic, owned by Matt Mullenberg
*   Interaction/relationship between the two

Although the Dashboards look quite different, the key concepts (pages, posts, themes, customizer, settings, media gallery, etc.) are the same.

## What do WordPress developers do?

As an IT professional, there's different ways of working with WordPress:

*   You can build websites for clients using, and adapting, existing WordPress Themes (=templates) and Plugins (=extensions to the default WordPress functionality).
*   You can create WordPress Themes for clients or to sell on platforms such as the Theme Repository or the Theme Forest.
*   You can create WordPress Plugins for clients or to sell on the Plugin Repository.

We will cover Themes and Plugins extensively during the course but, in the meantime, if you want to find out more, you can read these two articles:

Of course, you can also earn a living as a content editor, a blogger or a business owner with a WordPress website. But that'd be outside the scope of this course ;-)

## Homework

1.  **Create a blog with WordPress.com** \- The objective of this exercise is to help you become familiar with the key WordPress concepts.
    
    1.  Create a free account on wordpress.com and choose a name for the blog.
    2.  Choose a Theme.
    3.  Add an About page and type some content. A couple of lines will be enough.
    4.  Create a new Post and type some content.
    5.  Set the site language to English UK.
    6.  Choose to show only 3 posts per page and allow comments on posts, but comments should be approved by an administrator before being displayed.
    7.  Find a Copyright-free image with an appropriate size and use it as the site's header.
    8.  Add a menu with the following items: Home, About and Contact. "Home" should link to the main blog page and "Contact" should link to an email address.
    
    Do as many of the tasks below as you can but don't worry if you get stuck with any of the steps. There is a lot of information in the [WordPress.com support site](https://en.support.wordpress.com/) or, if you can't find a solution there, please ask on Slack.
    
2.  **Setup your localhost with Docker**
    1.  Follow the Docker tutorial above and make sure you have a local WordPress development environment ready for class.
    2.  Once you have succesfully set it up post an update on Slack, or ask for help if you are struggling to complete
    3.  Login to the admin interface of your Docker WordPress install and look around. Try replicating some of the steps you completed above for your WordPress.com account in your Docker install — do you notice many differences with the WordPress.com admin interface?
3.  **Explore and install a plugin**
    1. Find the plugins section (under Plugins > Add New). Search for a 'contact form' plugin (use the Search field in the top right).

        - **Don’t just install the first one in the search results** - read reviews, look at screenshots, read the installation instructions and consider what one to choose. 

    2. Install and Activate your chosen plugin.
